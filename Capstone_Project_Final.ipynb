    "## Introduction\n",
    "### In this capstone project I will be creating a program to compare the neighbourhoods of the two cities namely Brooklyn from New York and Downtown Toronto from Toronto and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. \n",
    "### I will be comparing all the venues , hotspots to visit, number of residential friendly places, etc. As we know  both Brooklyn and downtown Toronto are we very huge and diverse containing people from all around the world. These places have a lot of restaurants, cafes, pubs and so on. So by comparing these two neighbourhoods we can find a lot of similarities and see how these places vary. \n",
    "### I will use foursquare api to collect all the details and explore these regions and will be using k means to cluster different cateogaries of data and display it on the exact location using folium maps.\n",
    "### Later I will be using the two maps to differentiate between the neighbourhoods and see how one varies from the other. This analysis is mainly done when people are moving from one place to another for various purposes. They would want to have the same facilities in the new neighbourhood as they have in their current neighbourhood.\n",
    "### Thus by comparing various major cities based on its amenities and venues we make a proper analysis and visualize the data obtained using Data Science. \n"

    "#### I will also be needing the New York dataset so that I can extract all the information from Brooklyn. I obtained This data set from the lab as well:https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset\n",
